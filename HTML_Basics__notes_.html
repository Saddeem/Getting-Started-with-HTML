<h1>Main Concepts: HTML Basics</h1>
<b>1. Introduction</b> <br>
HTML Stands for <em>Hyper Text Markup Language</em>.  It consists of text <b>content, markup, references to other documents </b> (like images or videos) and/or <b>references to other pages</b>. <br> <br>

  <b>2. HTML Tags</b> <br>
  HTML tags are a way of changing how the texts looks on a webpage. It consists of an <b>opening tag</b>, followed by the <b>content</b>, which is what the tag is working on, then a <b>closing tag</b>. <br> <br>
  They are many different kinds of tags and each serve a different function. For example, to make a sentence bold, the <b> < b ></b> tag can be used. Another example is the italics tag, in which <b>< em ></b> is used instead of <b>< b ></b> making the content here italicized instead. It’s important to note that if we don’t close the tag, all content after the opening tag will be bold or italicized, and that’s the case with most tags. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZXDAGwD8Ng">This video</a> explains some other useful tags as well.   <br> <br>


<b>3.	Inline Vs Block Elements</b><br>
<b>Inline tags</b> are tags that can be placed within text without creating a line break. (like <b>< b >, < em ></b> and even <b>< img ></b>) <b>Block tags</b>, on the other hand, contain the text in an invisible box, hence the name block. The <b>< p ></b> tag, which stands for paragraph, wraps the text within a box that separates it from any other text surrounding it. The <b>< div ></b> tag works in a similar manner as well. The picture below demonstrates the contrast between the two: <br> <br> <br>
